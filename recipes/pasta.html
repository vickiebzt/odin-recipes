        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the clams in lightly salted, lukewarm water for 30 minutes, then drain and rinse, straining off any
                sand and grit
                that&prime;s leached from the clams</li>
            <li>Rinse and scrub the mussels, pulling away the hairy beards</li>
            <li>Clean and trim the squid, then cut it into rings</li>
            <li>Peel the prawns, removing the head and the black vein that runs along the middle of each prawn&prime;s
                back</li>
            <li>Halve the cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>Finely chop the parsley</li>
            <li>Peel and finely slice the garlic cloves</li>
            <li>If you&prime;re using a fresh chilli, take the seeds and dice it</li>
            <li>Measure out a medium glass of wine, around 175ml. Have some for you as well!</li>
            <li>Put a large pan of water on to boil for your pasta</li>
            <li>Warm the olive oil and garlic in a large frying pan over a low heat, cooking gently so as not to burn
                the garlic. Once fragrant, add the chilli and cook for a minute more</li>
            <li>Add the wine, turn the heat up to medium and add all of the seafood, letting everything cook away
                happily for a couple
                of minutes</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes and continue to cook, stirring regularly, until the clam and mussel shells open. Remove
                and discard any shells that didn&prime;t open</li>
            <li>While the seafood sauce bubbles away, salt your pasta water and, once it comes back to the boil, add
                your pasta. If
                using fresh, cook for 3-4 minutes, for dried, aim for 2 minutes less than the packet instructions</li>
            <li>Once the pasta is cooked, drain, reserving some pasta water. Add the spaghetti to the pan of seafood
                sauce, along with
                the parsley and a ladle of pasta cooking water, then cook for a final minute, swishing and swirling
                everything together</li>
            <li>Check the seasoning, then divide between bowls and enjoy. Buon appetito!
            </li>
